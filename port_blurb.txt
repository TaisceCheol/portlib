Port is a new web application developed by the Irish Traditional Music Archive. It allows users to search, view and listen to our collections of notated music. 

Port contains over 6000 tunes drawn from 41 historical collections which have been carefully set by staff at ITMA. 

Using Port you can search for tunes by title, time-signature or musical motif. You can also browse individual tune collections or jump to a random tune.

In addition, Port introduces the concept of ITMA numbers, which provide a unique identifier for printed traditional tunes. 

In the near future Port will also enable tune similarity searching.
