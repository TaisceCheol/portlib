            "Amhr\u00e1in Mhuighe Se\u00f3la is a classic collection of traditional songs in the Irish language, one of the relatively few to contain notated melodies as well as words.", 
            "These songs were collected in Co Galway and Co Mayo by Mrs Eileen Costello (Eibhl\u00edn Bean Mhic Choisdealbha) of Tuam in the early 20th century, and were published by the Irish Folk Song Society in London in 1919 as a number of its journal, and again in Dublin in 1923 by The Talbot Press, commercial publishers. On a variety of themes, they are mainly love songs. Maigh Seola is an ancient territory between Loughrea and Headford in Co Galway.", 
            "Mrs Costello was born Edith Drury in 1870 in St Pancras workhouse in London, where her Limerick father worked as an attendant. Her mother was Welsh. She became a teacher, and was in the 1890s prominent in a number of the then many Irish cultural organisations in London. A highly active member of the Gaelic League from its London foundation in 1896, she learned Irish there. Her song collecting in the Irish language began in London (she first collected 'Neill\u00ed Bh\u00e1n' on a train coming from Woolwich), but her collecting work really began in Ireland, in Tuam, where she came to live having in 1903 married a Dr Thomas Bodkin from the town. He was a medical doctor, historian, and fellow Gaelic Leaguer. Among her chief singers from 1904 was a Maggie Hession of Belclare, members of whose family are still involved in traditional music. Mrs Costello was active in the War of Independence and became a senator in the Irish Free State. She died in 1962. Although she supplied extensive source-notes to the songs and information on their backgrounds (with English translations mainly by others), her motivation was not academic. She intended her volume primarily 'for popular use in the schools and Gaelic League classes of Connacht'.",

Drawn to a great extent from the oral tradition of Munster, and partly from other manuscripts and printed sources, the collection has now been published for the first time.", 
            "This first volume of over 500 song airs and dance tunes, edited by Dr Hugh Shields from the manuscripts, contains all the melodies which Goodman himself noted down from the pipers and other performers of his native province, together with an essay on his life and career based on new research. These tunes provide musicians and scholars with a unique body of Irish music from the south-west region and give unrivalled insights into the traditional music and song of Irish-speaking pre-Famine Ireland.",

He published many articles and sound recordings on the subject, and his Shamrock, Rose and Thistle: Folk Singing in North Derry (1981) and Narrative Singing in Ireland: Lays, Ballads, Come-All-Yes and Other Songs (1993) are standard works."

            "Morris (later Maurice) Hime, a music seller, music publisher and lottery-office keeper, was active in Dublin from the 1790s to the 1810s. Of Jewish ancestry, he had first set up in the music trade about 1785 with his brother Humphrey in Liverpool. About 1791\u20132 he came to Dublin, and over the next three decades published sheet music and slim collections of songs, instrumental music and dance instructions from various addresses in the city centre: College Green and later Dame St, Westmoreland St and Eustace St. His speciality was the publishing of annual country-dance collections. Taking advantage of the fact that British copyright law did not at the time apply to Ireland, Hime is said to have supplied pirated copies of British publications to his brother for sale in England, and to have become wealthy as a result. He was married to Sophia Rhames, daughter of another Dublin music seller and publisher, and later lived in Roebuck in south County Dublin where he was a Church of Ireland vestry member and churchwarden in Taney. He died in early 1828.", 
            "Hime\u2019s publications are generally of popular British and Continental music, but his collection of country dances Forty Eight Original Irish Dances Never Before Printed claims to be Irish. Some of its melodies undoubtedly are, but others \u2013 such as \u2018Bobbing Joan\u2019 and \u2018Berwick Lasses\u2019 \u2013 had been appearing in English country-dance collections from early in the eighteenth century. They would however have been long naturalised in Ireland and would have formed part of the Irish repertory at the time of their publication here. While the collection is undated, it seems to have appeared about 1795\u20131800, earlier than dated country-dance collections Hime published in the opening decades of the 19th century. Two editions of the collection now in the National Library of Ireland have different title-pages. Although the contents and numbering of both are the same, the first is entitled Twenty Four Original Irish Dances Never Before Printed while the second, in a larger paper format, is entitled Forty Eight etc. Probably the first version of the Irish collection did contain 24 dances, but, when it proved popular, Hime produced a second volume of 24 which recycled the original title-page until a more comprehensive one could be created.",

Hardebeck (1869\u22121945; Hardebec in Irish). They were published in 1937 as Ceol na nGaedheal (music of the Irish), a small inexpensive collection suitable for school use, by the Dublin educational publishers Browne & Nolan Ltd (Br\u00fan agus \u00d3 Nuall\u00e1in Teor. in Irish). The scores were added to the site on the 70th anniversary of Hardebeck's death on 10 February 1945.", 
            "The booklet contains twenty-five popular national airs and dance tunes, and a basic tutorial introduction which views the tin whistle as an easy and cheap means of initiation to playing music for all children. With a view to giving easy access to the reading of music, its melodies are set in the tonic sol-fa notation which had been widely used in Irish primary schools since the 19th century.", 
            "The arrangements were produced in Hardebeck\u2019s last years, when he was living in poverty in Dublin, and they may have been commissioned from him as a practical support. Nevertheless they are interesting and original, and he evidently undertook the work seriously. The first line of tonic sol-fa generally carries the melody and the second provides harmony, but occasionally the melody alternates between the two lines.",

            "The two-line interactive music scores presented here are from published arrangements of traditional dance tunes made for piano sometime before or in 1921 by the English-born classical musician and dedicated arranger of Irish music Carl G. Hardebeck (1869\u22121945). They were published first in Dublin in two slim volumes by the obscure Crow St firm of Sullivan & Co, presumably in the early 1920s, and were republished and kept in print by the large Dublin specialist music publishers Pigott & Co of Grafton St. Facsimiles of the two published collections are available http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/print-collection/carl-hardebeck-instrumental-collections-of-the-1920s-1930s.", 
            "The 53 dance tunes of the volumes comprise, in Hardebeck\u2019s classification,  jigs and reels in a ratio of about 2:3, a hornpipe and a \u2018fancy dance\u2019. Some of his reels would however nowadays be regarded as hornpipes or set dances. His main sources were fiddlers \u2212 Sean O\u2019Gorman of Co Galway, Treasa Halpin of Limerick, a Mr O\u2019Curran of Co Waterford, and a John Duffy among them \u2013 and he tells us that his elaborate arrangements seek to imitate fiddle style, and are meant also to be played with a delicate early harpsichord tone. They are listening pieces, not intended for dancing. An indirect source, through O\u2019Curran, was the Co Waterford fiddle player and Irish music theorist Fr Richard Henebry. O\u2019Gorman had been taught by a Co Clare fiddle master and dance teacher, Lynch, and Hardebeck recommends the slow pace of his performances.", 
            "It seems clear that Hardebeck, in contrast to 19th-century arrangers of Irish music, adheres conscientiously to the tune versions and performance practice of his source musicians. He takes scrupulous care with the reproduction of traditional rhythms, for example, by making extensive use of crotchet-and-quaver triplets to represent the elusive traditional reel rhythm. He also faithfully reports a sharpened fourth interval where it occurs, in situations where a standard fourth would be preferred in standard usage today; he thus regularly specifies the Fah mode (which has now virtually disappeared from the tradition) for tunes that incorporate this phenomenon, which is amply attested in early sound recordings.",

            "The two-line interactive music scores presented here are from published arrangements of traditional dance tunes made for piano sometime before or in 1921 by the English-born classical musician and dedicated arranger of Irish music Carl G. Hardebeck (1869\u22121945). They were published first in Dublin in two slim volumes by the obscure Crow St firm of Sullivan & Co, presumably in the early 1920s, and were republished and kept in print by the large Dublin specialist music publishers Pigott & Co of Grafton St. Facsimiles of the two published collections are available http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/print-collection/carl-hardebeck-instrumental-collections-of-the-1920s-1930s.", 
            "The 53 dance tunes of the volumes comprise, in Hardebeck\u2019s classification,  jigs and reels in a ratio of about 2:3, a hornpipe and a \u2018fancy dance\u2019. Some of his reels would however nowadays be regarded as hornpipes or set dances. His main sources were fiddlers \u2212 Sean O\u2019Gorman of Co Galway, Treasa Halpin of Limerick, a Mr O\u2019Curran of Co Waterford, and a John Duffy among them \u2013 and he tells us that his elaborate arrangements seek to imitate fiddle style, and are meant also to be played with a delicate early harpsichord tone. They are listening pieces, not intended for dancing. An indirect source, through O\u2019Curran, was the Co Waterford fiddle player and Irish music theorist Fr Richard Henebry. O\u2019Gorman had been taught by a Co Clare fiddle master and dance teacher, Lynch, and Hardebeck recommends the slow pace of his performances.", 
            "It seems clear that Hardebeck, in contrast to 19th-century arrangers of Irish music, adheres conscientiously to the tune versions and performance practice of his source musicians. He takes scrupulous care with the reproduction of traditional rhythms, for example, by making extensive use of crotchet-and-quaver triplets to represent the elusive traditional reel rhythm. He also faithfully reports a sharpened fourth interval where it occurs, in situations where a standard fourth would be preferred in standard usage today; he thus regularly specifies the Fah mode (which has now virtually disappeared from the tradition) for tunes that incorporate this phenomenon, which is amply attested in early sound recordings.",

            "By the mid-nineteenth century, the Dublin professional artist and antiquarian George Petrie (c. 1790-1866) was recognised as the doyen of Irish traditional music collectors, and when in December 1851 the new Society for the Preservation and Publication of the Melodies of Ireland was established in Dublin, Petrie was the obvious choice as its president. The main immediate aim of the Society was to publish selections from the music manuscript collections which he had been making for over thirty years in the field and to which many other collectors had contributed. Joyce came into contact with Petrie about this time, and he was encouraged by the older man, who was some forty years his senior and whom he venerated, to contribute tunes and dance information to his collections, and to make his own collection.", 
            "In all, Joyce gave over 180 Co Limerick tunes to Petrie who published some 20 of them in his 1855 volume Ancient Music of Ireland, the first time that Joyce had achieved publication. After Petrie\u2019s death in 1866 a handful of Joyce tunes appeared in an incomplete Petrie volume of 1882, some 15 in Francis Hoffmann\u2019s 1877 Dublin publication Ancient Music of Ireland from the Petrie Collection Arranged for the Pianoforte, and some 160 in Charles V.

            "About 1940 Colm \u00d3 Lochlainn began the publication in Dublin of an undated series of penny Irish-language songsheets entitled An Claisceadal (\u2018choral singing\u2019).", 
            "By 1941 eighteen numbers had been published, produced by his Three Candles Press, and the series continued into the 1940s until it ended with the publication of sheet number 36.  The entire series is reproduced as scorch files below, and as a facsimile here.", 
            "These sheets were the latest manifestation of a number of influential Irish-language song publications by Colm \u00d3 Lochlainn which bear the title of An Claisceadal. This was originally the name of an informal choral group of Irish-language enthusiasts which had been brought together in Dublin in 1928 by \u00d3 Lochlainn and by Fion\u00e1n Mac Coluim, a Gaelic League organiser from Kerry. The singers were accompanied on piano by a Sligo music student Michael Bowles (M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Baoighill), later director of music on Radio \u00c9ireann and conductor of the National Orchestra of New Zealand. In the early 1930s \u00d3 Lochlainn began publishing a series of booklets of song texts sung by the group. These were taken up enthusiastically by Gaelic League branches, and the songs they contain became generally popular and widely sung.", 
            "Colm \u00d3 Lochlainn was a polymath: a Dublin printer, type designer and publisher, a political activist, an Irish scholar and Irish-language enthusiast, an editor of publications and journals, a singer and musician. For more on \u00d3 Lochlainn see below.", 
            "Colm \u00d3 Lochlainn\u2019s Irish-language songsheet series was clearly modelled on the old tradition of cheap printed street ballads. In contrast to street balladsheets, the Claisceadal sheets are printed on strong paper and on both sides \u2013 usually carrying two songs per sheet \u2013 and they also give the melody for each song, in staff notation. Each sheet was relatively small (12 x 19 cm). The sixty-nine songs of the series, some of them collected by \u00d3 Lochlainn himself, are from the then living traditions of the gaeltachta\u00ed (Irish-speaking districts), notably those of Conamara, Mayo and Munster. They are mostly light cheerful songs (\u2018amhr\u00e1in mheidhreacha\u2019): lullabies, dandling and other children\u2019s songs, spinning and other work songs, and love songs. The melodies are strong and regular, and many are also dance tunes. Some of the music notations seem to be in the hand of the famous traditional musician, singer and music collector S\u00e9amus Ennis, who worked for \u00d3 Lochlainn in the years about 1940. For facsimile reproductions of these songsheets, and more information on Colm \u00d3 Lochlainn see http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/print-collection/claisceadal-songsheets."

            "The undated Glasgow publication Allan\u2019s \u2018Irish Fiddler\u2019 has been an entry-level tunebook for aspiring fiddle players of Irish traditional music for over 60 years now. A cheap publication which has been widely distributed, it contains a substantial body of popular tunes, and is still available. Anyone who has absorbed its contents and learned to read its notations is well equipped to make progress in the music. In spite of the \u2018120\u2019 tunes mentioned on its title-page, the collection actually contains 131 melodies in 121 numbered sections. Interactive music scores for the 131 are presented here; for pdf versions suitable for printing click on the bottom right of each score.", 
            "The origins of the collection are something of a mystery. Its first date of publication is not now known; the earliest association date ITMA has been able to discover is April 1953. Although the book has been extensively used for decades, very few libraries hold copies; it is a perfect illustration of a common publication that was below the radar of most librarians. With its high proportion of tunes made current from the 1920s onward on gramophone records by Irish-American star performers like Michael Coleman and James Morrison, the collection seems to have been compiled in the mid-twentieth century. The identity of Hugh McDermott is likewise now a mystery. Was he an Irishman living in Scotland, or a Scot of Irish ancestry? Given the dance-music orientation of his collection and the appropriateness of his markings for fiddle fingering and bowing, he was probably an active fiddle player who provided music for feis or ceili dancers.", 
            "Mozart Allan, publisher of the collection and member of a music-publishing family active in Glasgow since the 1820s, was a prolific publisher of Scottish and general popular music in the twentieth century. This present collection was followed up by the firm's publication of Allan\u2019s \u2018Irish Pianist\u2019 (Piano Part of the Irish Fiddler) with the 131 tunes split into two separately published parts edited by Ian MacLeish and arranged for piano and piano-accordion. It is similarly undated but may possibly be a publication of the late 1980s (Part 1 was purchased by ITMA in January 1989, Part 2 in July 1990). The Mozart Allan firm has ceased trading within the last decade.",

            "By the 1920s, melodeons and accordions had become well established in Irish traditional music, especially in Irish America where they were popular band instruments. Agents for Globe accordions in particular were successfully targeting Irish players in the United States by the mid-1920s with a variety of amateur and professional instruments, and using the prominent Cork-Boston accordion player Jerry O\u2019Brien in advertising campaigns. At the end of the decade New York resident James C. Morrison of Riverstown, Co Sligo, well known in the city on stage, record and radio, was commissioned to write a tutor for the Globe accordion. \u2018Professor\u2019 Morrison (1893\u20131947) was primarily famous as a fiddle player, but he also sold, played and taught the accordion, among other instruments. He included in the tutor a selection of tunes suitable for beginners, reproduced on the left, from the popular contemporary repertory, most of which had been published on Irish commercial recordings in New York.", 
            "The diatonic Globe accordion for which Morrison wrote the tutor would today be described as a ten-key melodeon. Since he left no recordings as an accordion or melodeon player, we have no idea of his proficiency on the instrument, but he is known to have had close associations with noted players of the instrument of his day, including the melodeon player P.J. Conlon and the accordionist Tom Carmody, with both of whom he recorded. While the ten-key melodeon has great expressive possibilities, particularly for dance music, it is quite limited in musical compass in comparison to other instruments in the Irish tradition. Judging from his music scores, Morrison had a well-grounded understanding of the strengths and limitations of the instrument. He modifies tunes where necessary to fit them to the compass of the instrument, and carefully tailors each element of the scores to its characteristics.", 
            "A Globe accordion played by James Morrison in New York has recently been donated to the James Morrison Music Festival in his native Riverstown: see here. For a biography of Morrison by Harry Bradshaw and 30 remastered tracks of his music, see the double audio cassette James Morrison: The Professor (Viva Voce 001, Dublin, 1989). Morrison\u2019s tutor and tune book of 1931 was doubtless an exemplar for an accordion tutor and tune book of 1949 by Jerry O\u2019Brien in Boston (see http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/score/JOB_ACC1).", 
            "ITMA has a photocopy of Morrison\u2019s accordion tutor, kindly donated to it by Hugh E. O'Rourke of New York, from which these tunes were set. It would always welcome a donation of the original tutor, or a loan of it for digital scanning."

In 1928 he also made one solo 78 rpm recording for the Columbia company of New York before the Great Depression of 1929 brought most Irish-American recording to a halt. In a period of rising prosperity after the Second World War he began recording solo again, this time for the Irish-American Copley label of Boston, and also in duet with a young local star pupil Joe Derrane. The Copley label had been set up in 1948 by Justus O\u2019Byrne DeWitt, son of an Ellen O\u2019Byrne DeWitt who had been involved in the recording industry in New York since 1916. O\u2019Brien also designed for the company the O\u2019Byrne DeWitt Irish Professional Accordion.", 
            "The success of O\u2019Brien and Derrane\u2019s Copley recordings gave rise to two Boston book publications by E. O'Byrne DeWitt's Sons, both compiled by Jerry O\u2019Brien and with a repertory heavily influenced by gramophone records. The first was his accordion tutor and tune book of 1949 from which the tunes are reproduced on the left, and for which James Morrison\u2019s 1931 tutor for the Globe accordion (see here), an instrument which O\u2019Brien had played, was doubtless an exemplar. O\u2019Brien\u2019s second publication was an Irish tune book of 1952.", 
            "This tutor is primarily for the two-row accordion in D and C sharp, i.e., one of the two \u2018press-and-draw\u2019 systems used by accordion players in the Irish tradition. The system taught here (sometimes known among players as the \u2018outside-in\u2019 system) is now virtually obsolete, but it is still played by a very loyal minority of players of the Irish accordion. Prominent current players include Joe Derrane of Boston, whose music is featured in the book. The music and the musical ethos embodied in the tutor is, however, still very much alive in the Irish tradition today, thanks largely to its successful revival by the group De Danann in the 1980s.",

            "One of the most unusual collections of Irish music must be Padraic Ganly\u2019s collection of jigs, reels, hornpipes, airs, etc., composed by himself in traditional idiom, which he had printed on 1 July 1918 by Francisco de Paula at 1053 Av. de Mayo, Buenos Aires, and which he presumably published in that Argentinian city immediately afterwards.", 
            "It is not yet known who Ganly was and how he came to be publishing his compositions so far from Ireland. But on the internal evidence of the titles he gave to his 110 tunes, he was Irish-born and of rural origins. Townland names and other placenames abound in the collection. They are overwhelmingly from Co Westmeath, with a few from the surrounding counties, and the majority refer to an area east of Lough Ree and north of Athlone. The townland of Ballynacliffy is especially singled out. With the exception of \u2018Che Buono\u2019s Rambles\u2019, the family names of friends mentioned  \u2013 Adamson, Ginnell, Doolan, etc. \u2013 are in general accord with such a place of origin. It is likely that Ganly belonged to the Irish community in Argentina that was associated with a long tradition of emigration to that country from the Irish midlands.", 
            "Ganly was clearly an Irish-Irelander of his time: he calls the collection \u2018a modest contribution to the Gaelic revival\u2019, and dedicates it to \u2018eis\u00e9irge na Gaedhilge agus go h\u00c9irinn [na] nGaedhael\u2019. He was also a politically conscious Irish nationalist of the 1910s who was keeping up with the latest news from home: early tunes are entitled \u2018The Old Fenian\u2019s Favourite\u2019, \u2018The Men of \u201867\u2019 and \u2018The Land for the People\u2019, but he goes on to include \u2018Our Men of Easter Week\u2019 and \u2018Ashbourne\u2019s Fighting Gaels\u2019, and to name tunes for \u2018Countess Markievicz\u2019 and \u2018De Valera\u2019.", 
            "The title-page of the collection indicates that the compositions are primarily intended for violin and flute, and Ganly\u2019s titles \u2013 \u2018The Strings of Nancy\u2019s Violin\u2019, \u2018The Blind Fiddler\u2019, \u2018A Flute and Tambourine\u2019, etc. \u2013 seem to confirm this concentration. But other musical performance is also referred to: lilting, whistling, and especially bagpiping. By this he seems to mean mouth-blown bagpiping, and some few of these tunes could have been meant for playing at public political events, as could \u2018The Sinn Fein Volunteers\u2019, a B flat march possibly intended for brass instruments. Padraic Ganly may have been a teacher of music. The notations exhibit a high degree of musical literacy and, although they are mostly set in one or two sharps or flats, which would have suited an amateur market, they are in fact technically demanding. The collection itself seems to become progressively more difficult in performance terms, and thus to have a tutorial dimension. There are also indications that at least two editions of the collection were produced: there is an errata list in the 1 July 1918 printing but these errors have been corrected in a later printing.

The book is known to have been a source of repertory for many prominent Irish players, including such notable players of complicated hornpipes as the fiddle players James Morrison and Se\u00e1n Maguire. However, there are many extremely simple tunes in the collection as well, and this makes it a fruitful source of tunes for players of every level of competence."

It is one which predates the quadrille-based polkas and slides which now characterise the music of this region on the borders of counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick, and which are thought to have been first introduced in the late nineteenth century.",
"Perhaps the most interesting item the manuscript contains, from a historical viewpoint, is a unique version of 'Máirseáil Alasdruim' (as 'Alexander Gigg') and a related tune 'Church Hill'. Both form part of a famous suite of traditional programme music which commemorated a north Cork battle of 1647. This was once popular throughout Munster, especially among uilleann pipers, but has long ago vanished from the live tradition. Also revealing of the richness of the music of the region at the time of the manuscript's compilation are the elaborate slow airs it contains.",
"The contents are otherwise typical of Irish traditional music manuscripts of its period: a mixture of jigs, reels, hornpipes, song airs, country dances, and other popular current items, including English and Scottish pieces. Many seem to have come originally from printed sources, but the semi-literate spelling of some titles – especially of those in Irish – indicates also an oral dimension to the collection. Judging from the occasional use of bowing marks, it may have been at least partly compiled by fiddle players.",
"The manuscript was acquired by Breandán Breathnach (1912-85) through an 'E. Finnegan from D. Curtin of Stagmount, Rockchapel', Co Cork. It was among the Breathnach papers donated to ITMA by his family in 1987, and it had been indexed by him for his massive file-card resources which are now also in ITMA. It has been digitised by ITMA staff for preservation and dissemination.  Interactive scores of the music are also available here.",
"The manuscript consists of twenty-one 24 x 16 cm leaves of music paper pre-printed on both sides, and hand-sewn in a homemade leather cover. It contains forty-two pages of music in varying states of legibility, written in staff notation by more than one hand and perhaps over more than one generation. The volume has been paginated twice, the second time by Breathnach, and the confused original pagination shows that the first two leaves at least are now missing from it. It is also otherwise incomplete: there are several instances of tunes lacking beginnings or ends. The manuscript has been scanned and is presented in the exact order in which it is now bound, which is sometimes in conflict with both paginations.",
"Although the manuscript is undated, it probably belongs to the mid-nineteenth century. The latest dateable item it contains is ‘Pop Goes the Weasel’, a tune which enjoyed a craze from the 1850s. A mid-century date seems confirmed by the fact that it contains no polkas or slides as such. Various names and addresses are inscribed in the manuscript: John O'Sullivan; Humphrey O' Sullivan; Edmond Scanlan, Mellan by Rockchapel, Co Cork; E. Coakley; Minnie D. Curtin; Thomas Leahy; Mrs Tom Leahy, Ballycomane, Tournafulla, Co Limerick; David Curtin; and Mike Murphy. From these, it is clear that the manuscript originally belongs to the Sliabh Luachra area.",
"The manuscript, which Breathnach called the 'Curtin manuscript', can usefully be compared with the ITMA manuscripts of the twentieth-century Sliabh Luachra fiddle and accordion teacher Pádraig O'Keeffe which are available in facsimile and as interactive music scores here. Echoes of a local slow-air tradition suggested in the Curtin manuscript may have survived into the twentieth century in the many airs played by O'Keeffe and imparted by him to his pupils.",

"In his teacher-training, O’Keeffe would have learned the rudiments of staff notation and tonic solfa, but for his own teaching purposes he devised more intuitive tablature systems. For the fiddle he employed the four spaces of the music staff to correspond with the strings of the instrument, and with numerals indicating which fingers were to be pressed down. For the accordion he used numerals for the keys to be pressed and in- and out-symbols to indicate the direction of the bellows. Hundreds of the notations he left with pupils have been preserved in private hands, and two volumes of facsimiles have been published (Dan Herlihy, Sliabh Luachra Music Masters vols 1 & 2, Herlihy, Killarney, 2003 & 2007), but his music has not yet been comprehensively collected.",

An eccentric and notably witty character with a gift for musical variation, he left an indelible stamp on the music and folklore of the region, and is an example of how an individual musician may almost create a local music style.",
"In his teacher-training, O’Keeffe would have learned the rudiments of staff notation and tonic solfa, but for his own teaching purposes he devised more intuitive tablature systems. For the fiddle he employed the four spaces of the music staff to correspond with the strings of the instrument, and with numerals indicating which fingers were to be pressed down. For the accordion he used numerals for the keys to be pressed and in- and out-symbols to indicate the direction of the bellows. Hundreds of the notations he left with pupils have been preserved in private hands, and two volumes of facsimiles have been published (Dan Herlihy, Sliabh Luachra Music Masters vols 1 & 2, Herlihy, Killarney, 2003 & 2007), but his music has not yet been comprehensively collected.",
"The O’Keeffe fiddle and accordion manuscripts presented here below as scans have been kindly donated to ITMA by Paud Collins from Knockacur, Knocknagoshel, Co Kerry, a former accordion pupil of O’Keeffe’s whose brothers Jer on fiddle and Dan on accordion were also pupils. The fiddle manuscripts are in Pádraig O’Keeffe’s own hand, while the accordion manuscripts were copied for her brothers from O’Keeffe’s originals by Paud Collins’s sister Tess Drudy (who did not herself read the tablature).",
"The four sets of ITMA-Collins O'Keeffe facsimile manuscripts and the interactive music scores derived from them constitute the largest body of O'Keeffe's music that is publicly available.",
